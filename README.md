```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Installing Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, open a terminal and run:

## Fix an inconsistency
Due to the structure of the WEB repository, there is a minor inconsistency between the main repository and its submodule. To fix this, navigate to: 
```
app/server_side/directory_manager.py
```
Then, on **line 4**, replace: 
```
from log_handler import log_message
```
with:
```
from app.server_side.log_handler import log_message
```

Now you're ready! ðŸš€
